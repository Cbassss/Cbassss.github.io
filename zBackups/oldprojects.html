                <p class="project-description">Inspired by a book called H.I.V.E. I read about a person that had this sword that pulsed this deep purple and I knew I had to make it. I used my CAD skills to create the frame that encases the arduino. I spent many iterations making it fit snugly in the container but still look good. I used my programming knowledge to program the arduino to pulse the RGB LED and turn off when I click a button on the top of the box. </p>

                <h2 class="project-title">FPV drone</h2>
                <p class="project-description">I have always been interested in birds and their ability to fly. Once I saw a video of someone flying a cool shot I thought it was interesting, but once I saw that they were seeing it with VR-like goggles, I knew I had to get one. I used my research skills to find out what components are the best and lightest(to not break any FAA rules). I used my CAD skills to create the frame and optimize it so that it was strong and light. A frame that i s 3D printed is way less stable than the standard 3” carbon fiber frames so I had to iterate and go through many failures to find something that worked. I have had many problems, Some causing me to lose or break my drone, but I am still iterating and trying to make the drone fly stable while still being 3D printed.</p>

                <p class="project-description">My parents wanted something to make sure their counter wouldn’t get scratched. They asked me to design something. After thinking for some time, I thought it would be fun to make little people hold it up, all with different faces or poses. I took measurements, then designed them in CAD and printed them. They turned out well and are being used.</p>
